# Dependencies

The required dependencies and their versions are listed in
`x-label.cabal`.

# Installation

## Using Setup.hs

    runhaskell Setup configure
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install

## Using cabal-install

    cabal install

## Installing the manual page

None of the procedures above installs the manual page, as Cabal
currently has no convenient way to do so.  Instead run the following
command to generate it from the README.

    pandoc --standalone --read markdown --write man --output x-label.1 README

Copy the resulting file to `/usr/local/man/man1` or somewhere else
in your `MANPATH`.

# Usage

See the x-label `README` which is also the manual page for notes on
the usage.
