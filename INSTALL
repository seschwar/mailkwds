# Dependencies

The library dependencies and their versions are listed in the file
`mailkwds.cabal`.  To generate the man page [pandoc] is required.

# Installation

## Using `Setup.hs`

    ./Setup.hs configure
    ./Setup.hs build
    ./Setup.hs install

## Using cabal-install

    cabal install

## Installing the manual page

None of the procedures above installs the manual page, as [Cabal]
currently has no convenient way to do so.  Instead run the following
command to generate it from the README.

    pandoc -sS -f markdown -t man -o mailkwds.1 README

Copy the resulting file to `/usr/local/man/man1` or somewhere else
in your `MANPATH`.

    install -Dm644 mailkwds.1 /usr/local/man/man1/mailkwds.1

# Usage

See the `README` or the manual page for notes on the usage.
