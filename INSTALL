# Dependencies

For the required dependencies and their versions see the file
`x-label.cabal`.

# Installation

## Using Setup.hs

    runhaskell Setup configure
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install

## Using cabal-install

    cabal install

## Installing the manual page

None of the procedures above installs the manual page, as Cabal
currently has no convenient way to do so.  Instead run the following
command to generate it from the README.

    pandoc --standalone --read markdown --write man --output x-label.1 README

Copy the resulting file to `/usr/local/share/man/man1` or somewhere
else in you `MANPATH`.

# Usage

See the x-label `README`/manual page for notes on the usage.
