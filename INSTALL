# Dependencies

Apart from the usual base libraries this program has no further runtime
dependencies.  Obviously Cabal is required for the compilation and
Pandoc for the generation of the manual page.

# Installation

## Using Setup.hs

    runhaskell Setup configure
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install

## Using cabal-install

    cabal install

## Installing the manual page

None of the procedures above installs the manual page, as Cabal
currently has no convenient way to do so.  Instead run the following
command to generate it from the README.

    pandoc -sS -f markdown -t man -o - README | gzip > x-label.1.gz

Copy the resulting file to `/usr/share/man/man1` or somewhere else
in you `MANPATH`.

# Usage

See the x-label `README`/manual page for notes on the usage.
